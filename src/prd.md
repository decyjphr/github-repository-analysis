## Performance & Scalability Requirements

### Data Size Handling
- **Small Datasets** (< 1,000 repos): Full featured experience with all data points
- **Medium Datasets** (1,000 - 5,000 repos): Automatic async processing with performance warnings
- **Large Datasets** (5,000 - 10,000 repos): Performance mode enabled by default with downsampling
- **Very Large Datasets** (10,000+ repos): Web Worker utilization with progressive rendering

### Optimization Techniques Implemented
1. **Data Downsampling**: LTTB algorithm and systematic sampling to reduce points while preserving visual shape
2. **Async Processing**: Non-blocking data calculations with loading states
3. **Virtual Rendering**: Only render visible chart elements
4. **Progressive Loading**: Incremental data processing for better perceived performance
5. **Web Workers**: Heavy computations moved to background threads
6. **Smart Binning**: Optimal bin calculation algorithms for histograms
7. **Point Deduplication**: Remove overlapping points in scatter plots

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Professional confidence and analytical precision
- **Design Personality**: Clean, data-focused, enterprise-ready
- **Visual Metaphors**: Dashboard interfaces, scientific analysis tools
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Rich interface with organized complexity

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with accent colors for data visualization
- **Primary Color**: Deep navy blue for interface elements
- **Secondary Colors**: Light grays for backgrounds and borders
- **Accent Color**: Warm orange for highlights and data points
- **Color Psychology**: Trust (blue), clarity (white/gray), attention (orange)

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Inter for all text (consistent, readable, modern)
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headers, data labels, and body text
- **Font Personality**: Professional, clean, highly legible
- **Which fonts**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700 weights)

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: 
  - Cards for section organization
  - Tabs for navigation between analysis types
  - Tables for detailed data display
  - Select dropdowns for configuration options
  - Badges for status indicators
- **Component States**: Hover effects, active selections, loading states
- **Spacing System**: Consistent 4px base grid with generous whitespace

## Feature Scaling Implementation

### Scaling Methods Available
1. **No Scaling**: Raw data values for direct interpretation
2. **Min-Max Normalization**: Scales values to 0-1 range for comparable distributions
3. **Z-Score Standardization**: Centers data around mean=0, std=1 for normal distribution analysis
4. **Robust Scaling**: Uses median and IQR for outlier-resistant scaling

### View Options
- **Chart View**: Interactive histogram with tooltips and responsive design
- **Table View**: Detailed frequency table with counts, percentages, and cumulative statistics

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Empty CSV files**: Graceful handling with appropriate error messages
- **Missing columns**: Validation against required schema
- **Invalid data types**: Data cleaning and type conversion
- **Large file sizes**: Progress indicators and chunked processing
